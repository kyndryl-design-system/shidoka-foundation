## Usage

It is recommended to use an SVG loader to inject the SVG as inline HTML into your app. More info on SVG loaders can be found in the [Shidoka Icons repo](https://github.com/kyndryl-design-system/shidoka-icons?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-an-svg-inline-loader).

### Example Import

```js
import iconName from '@kyndryl-design-system/shidoka-foundation/assets/svg/<filename>';
```

The method for placing them in your app at this point will vary based on the framework/loader.

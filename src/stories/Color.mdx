## Themes

We use [CSS light-dark() syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark) for our Semantic tokens so themes can be managed easily. It is recommended to use the automatic theme based on user preference unless you are migrating from 1.x and need time to manually update custom code to accomodate dark mode.

### Setting a Theme

Add the following tag to your application's `<head>`:

```html
<!-- automatic theme based on user preference, recommended -->
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
<!-- use light theme -->
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light" />
<!-- use dark theme -->
<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark" />
```

### Hot-Swapping Themes

Applications can incorporate a theme switcher for users, which can operate simply by changing the value in the above example. You'll notice we have one built-in to Storybook.

## Using Tokens

```css
.your-css-selector {
  background-color: var(--kd-color-page-bg);
}
```
